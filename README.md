Brightcove and Youbora Integration
===================================

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/khanna91/bcsample <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and check to see it works, assuming you have npm installed globally ;)

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # It will serve the application
```

## Run Application locally

```bash
$ http://localhost:3000
```
